# FINOS Open Reg Tech - LCR
Welcome to the Open Reg Tech implementation of the US Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The goal of the project is to establish the delivery and collaboration of regulations in code. 

# Documentation
[The Documentation](doc/README.md) Is a good place to read about the LCR regulation and how this project implements it.

In addition, FINOS runs a server with the [Latest Interactive LCR](https://lcr-interactive.finos.org/) to explore the 
implementation for non-technical users.

## Status
The current implementation is *almost* complete.  We've left a small portion incomplete so that we can finish the remainder as a community. This will provide experience and insight on the experience of the community collaborating on regulations.

## Tentative Roadmap

1. Agree on the regulation (LCR)
2. Contribute existing LCR implementation into a new project in FINOS (done)
3. Implement the remainder of the LCR as a Open Reg Tech SIG team effort
4. Decide on an execution environment (i.e., Spark)
5. Enable procurement of the data with Legend
6. Demonstrate the complete solution.
